## Assignment 2: Chat application  
Tested on ubuntu 20.04  

### Install dependencies
`sudo apt-get install build-essential`  
`sudo apt-get install net-tools`  

### Directory structure
bin/: Final compiled binary files  
source/: C source code  
Makefile: automation tool  

### Compiling the program
Open terminal in the chat directory and run:  
`make compile`  

### Running the program(s)
Start the server first  
`./bin/server`  

Start the client only after starting the server  
`./bin/client`  

Note:
Both the client and server can only send a message once it has received one and vice versa.  

To avoid subsequent connection error(s): close the client before closing the server.  

### Net commands
Check if port is in use:  
`netstat -ltnp | grep -w ':9051'`  

Kill process that's using it:  
`kill -9 <PID>`
